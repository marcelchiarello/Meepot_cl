You are tasked with creating a comprehensive, optimized prompt that will instruct an AI coding assistant to build Meepot - a modern event management platform. You have access to the following resources in the Docs folder:

Prompt Generation Guide - A framework for creating effective web application prompts
BUSINESS_RULES.md - Detailed business logic and permission systems
DATA_MODEL_AND_INTEGRATIONS.md - Complete data architecture and external services
FUNCTIONAL_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md - Comprehensive functional specifications
use-cases.md - Detailed user scenarios and workflows

Your Task
Using the Prompt Generation Guide as your framework, create a single, comprehensive prompt that will enable an AI agent to build a fully functional, modern version of Meepot. The prompt should:
1. Follow the Guide Structure

Start with clear identity and context
Use the optimal phrase patterns identified in the guide
Apply the priority system (P0/P1/P2) for features
Include all sections from the optimized template

2. Incorporate Meepot Specifics

Extract core functionalities from FUNCTIONAL_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md
Implement the exact permission matrix from BUSINESS_RULES.md
Use the data model structure from DATA_MODEL_AND_INTEGRATIONS.md
Cover key use cases from use-cases.md

3. Emphasize Modern Technology

Specify cutting-edge tech stack (React 18+, Next.js 14+, TypeScript 5+)
Use modern UI libraries (Shadcn/ui, Framer Motion, Tailwind CSS)
Implement real-time features with modern WebSocket solutions
Include Progressive Web App capabilities
Specify modern authentication (NextAuth.js or similar)
Use edge functions and serverless architecture where appropriate

4. Prioritize Key Features
Based on the documentation, organize features by priority:

P0: Core event CRUD, invitation system, RSVP management
P1: Task management, cost tracking, role-based permissions
P2: AI chatbot, social features, advanced analytics

5. Include Critical Implementation Details

Role-based permission system with 6 roles and specific permissions
Multiple invitation types (personal, group, private, public, hierarchical)
Cost calculation and settlement optimization algorithms
Real-time synchronization requirements
Offline-first architecture with sync capabilities

6. Specify Quality Requirements

Mobile-first responsive design
60fps animations and interactions
Lighthouse score 90+ for all metrics
WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
Comprehensive error handling and recovery

Expected Output
Generate a single, production-ready prompt that:

Can be given directly to an AI coding assistant
Results in a complete, modern Meepot implementation
Follows all best practices from the guide
Incorporates all business logic from the documentation
Uses the most modern web technologies available
Creates a beautiful, performant, and user-friendly application

Important Notes

The generated prompt should be self-contained but can reference that the AI agent has access to the documentation files
Focus on creating a prompt that results in actual working code, not just specifications
Ensure the prompt emphasizes modern UX patterns like optimistic updates, skeleton screens, and micro-interactions
Include specific instructions for implementing the complex features like the settlement algorithm and invitation workflows
Make sure to specify that all features should be fully functional, not placeholders

Create this optimal prompt now, ensuring it will result in a modern, feature-complete version of Meepot that exceeds current web application standards.
