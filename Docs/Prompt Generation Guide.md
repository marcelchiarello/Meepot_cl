IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES:

Code Organization:
src/
├── components/    # Reusable UI components
├── pages/        # Page components
├── hooks/        # Custom React hooks
├── utils/        # Helper functions
├── styles/       # Global styles
└── types/        # TypeScript types

Component Standards:
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Props validation with TypeScript
- Consistent naming conventions
- Maximum 50 lines per component

State Management:
- Local state for component-specific data
- Context for cross-component state
- External state management for complex apps

Quality Standards:
- No console errors or warnings
- Comprehensive error boundaries
- Loading states for all async operations
- Responsive design mobile-first

DELIVERABLES:

Output Format:
- Complete, production-ready application
- All features fully implemented
- No placeholder content
- Ready for deployment

Code Requirements:
- Clean, well-commented code
- TypeScript for type safety
- Consistent formatting
- Performance optimized

Documentation:
- README with setup instructions
- Inline code comments for complex logic
- Component usage examples

CONSTRAINTS & CONSIDERATIONS:

Critical Requirements:
- MUST be fully functional on first run
- MUST handle all error states gracefully
- MUST be responsive across all devices
- MUST follow security best practices

Performance Constraints:
- Initial load under 3 seconds
- Smooth 60fps animations
- Optimized asset loading

Testing Expectations:
- Manual testing of all features
- Edge case verification
- Cross-browser compatibility check

PRIORITY EMPHASIS:
Focus on creating a beautiful, functional application that works flawlessly from the first interaction. Prioritize user experience and visual polish while maintaining code quality and performance.
